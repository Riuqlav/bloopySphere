# Emitter
[Project Page](https://github.com/emitter-io/emitter)

## Warning
This is an experiment. I am working on an incubator chart for this. I have a lot on my plate so this will take a while. In the meantime this is to get acquainted with the functionality.

## Notes
- Deploys as a Stateful Set
- Requires a license, which can be generated
- Repo has Dockerfile. lacks ARM image. Need to figure out how to 'patch' it for kah/container-images. My ARM node is already tainted with NoSchedule so I will simply ignore adding any tolerations here
